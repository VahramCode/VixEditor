Vix Editor
Vix Editor is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor built with Python. Inspired by the simplicity of Windows Notepad, the efficiency of command-line tools, and the powerful modal editing concepts found in Vim, Vix aims to provide a quick and intuitive editing experience for developers and casual users alike. It allows you to seamlessly open existing files or create new ones directly from your terminal.
Features
 * Lightweight & Fast: Built with Python for minimal resource usage.
 * Command-Line Interface: Edit files directly from your terminal.
 * Auto-create Files: Automatically creates a new file if the specified file doesn't exist.
 * Cross-Platform (Linux): Designed primarily for Linux environments.
Prerequisites
Vix Editor is developed with Python 3 and requires the tkinter library for its graphical interface.
To install tkinter:
On Ubuntu/Debian based systems:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

On Fedora based systems:
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

   This script will copy the necessary files to the correct system paths (/opt/vix and /usr/local/bin).
