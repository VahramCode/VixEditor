# Vix Editor

**Vix Editor** is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor built with Python. Inspired by the straightforward simplicity of **Windows Notepad**, the efficiency of **Windows Command Line** interactions, and the powerful modal editing philosophies found in **Vim**, Vix aims to provide a fast and intuitive text editing experience directly within your terminal. It allows users to seamlessly open existing files or create new ones on the fly.
